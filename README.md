# Registration Form
# Project Description

The purpose of this project is to showcase my proficiency in JavaScript document manipulation. It features a user-friendly registration form where individuals can input their names and email addresses. Upon submission, the details are processed instantly.

One notable feature is the inclusion of a hidden warning message. If a user attempts to submit the form with any fields left empty, the message "Please enter all fields" appears briefly, highlighted with a red background. This visual cue alerts users to complete all required fields before proceeding.

Furthermore, the project includes a hidden section where all submitted details are displayed. This provides users with a convenient way to review the information they've entered.

This project serves as both a demonstration of technical skills and a practical tool for capturing user data in a streamlined manner.
